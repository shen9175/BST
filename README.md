# BST
This is also a practice of my study C++11 new features smart pointer and template class. 
It is a implementation of binary search tree with parent pointer using template class.

It's implement full function of BST, and the highlight is horizontal print tree structure.
The printing function has some inteligent to determine the width of the tree in each level
The testtree.txt shows the output the test case and the tree print art.
